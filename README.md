# Tumor-Biochemical-Heterogeneity-and-Oncology-Network-Breakdown-Zone-Model

We present the two models (k-shell) and (k-sorted) we have described in the paper.
To run each file, provide the seed of the realization. For example run: 

python3 kShells.py <seedNumber>
  
the saved files will have the seed in their name.
  
In each of those files a function Pk is included. Applying this function in the timestep of the realization you want, you can obtain the distribution of the k values.
